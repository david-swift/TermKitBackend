# ``TermKitBackend``

_TermKitBackend_ is a declarative framework allowing the creation of user interface for the terminal. It works on Linux, macOS and Windows thanks to the [TermKit project](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TermKit).

## Overview

The declarative approach is based on the [Meta package](https://aparokshaui.github.io/meta/) which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AparokshaUI/Meta).
It is powered by [a fork of TermKit for Swift](https://github.com/david-swift/TermKit).
